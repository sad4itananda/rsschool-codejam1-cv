				<h2>Summary</h2>
				<p>
					My goal is to study front-end development, to continue deepening in this direction, with time studying new ones. Programming gives me not only the chance of employment, but also the opportunity to develop to me both as individuals and mentally, which is suitable for me. It's great to spend time on self-development!
